Role Name
=========

Role to automagically ensure RHEL based hosts meet PCI Compliance.  Basically I need to convert
a big playbook properly into a role when I find the time.

I don't have alot of time, so this is just a placeholder.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - pci

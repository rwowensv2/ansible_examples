# getJBossHeath.yml
# Author: Robert Owens (xxxxxx)
# Developers like to have health status pages that show endpoint connectivity
# jdbc connectivity, etc.  This will fetch those pages from Production and
# email to developers who don't have access (PCI).
# Notes:
# get_url module
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/get_url_module.html
# mail module
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/mail_module.html
# stat module, pull the file into a register
# fail module
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/fail_module.html
# Future:  Use Reigister instead of File write, and use mail module.
# You can first check that the destination file exists or not and then make a decision based on the output of it's result.
